//Very basic example of using jsonautotree to read a few example nodes and//structure the tree and branches automatically.var nodeTree = require('./jsonautotree.js');var fs = require('fs');//I normally install the fs functions and then just grab every node in the libvar nodes = fs.readdirSync('./examples/nodes');for (var i=0;i<nodes.length;i++) {    nodeTree.buildBranch('./examples/nodes/' + nodes[i]);}//Then get a node and all its properties, grabbed heirarchicallyvar school = nodeTree.getNode('school');//Test to make sure school inherited the shape propertyconsole.log("Nodetype 'school' has 'shape' property of: " + school.shape);
